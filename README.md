## About The Project

This is the 1st Microverse Solo Project. The 4th Project in total. Purpose: Duplicate old Apple page.

<br>

A little inspirational context: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omveFR-2hmg">What will your verse be?</a> Feel free to switch 'verse' for 'code' and back again.

Project created using HTML and CSS3

<br>

<b>After my code being rejected several times I decided to create a new branch called 'The Phoenix' and start again from scratch. I did this for several reasons. I had been sick this week and the project caught me a little bit off-guard. My mentor also told me that I could look at other peoples' code for the same project and that it would be OK just as long as I made sure I understood it. In the end I wasn't really sure if I understood it, therefore 'The Phoenix'. I received no help with the latter. Here the branch 'Front-Page' was merged from 'The Phoenix'.</b>
